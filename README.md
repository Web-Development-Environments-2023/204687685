I built my site for Moshe Nussbaum because I think he is a very brave and very smart man who is dealing with an incurable disease, and he still thinks optimistically about life. I find it inspiring and admirable.

I designed the site in such a way that it would suit Moshe's character - a serious news reporter all his life. I chose to use colors that characterize the channel he works in and kept a minimalist, innovative and formal design.
